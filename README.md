### Warning
<p>I will not frequently update/fix this mod because I'm new to Minecraft modding (can't really do too much to fix major issues) and I won't consider learning to mod for 1.7.10. <br>
This mod was only created for my friends so that we could enjoy some 1.7.10 packs without destroying our GPUs.</p>

### Description
<p>Press F3 + A can refresh GL display lists. It can also detect your GPU's current free memory and trigger the main function.</p>

### Credits
<p>Main function source code copied from @TechoMan from the AMD community.<br>
